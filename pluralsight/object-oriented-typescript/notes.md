## Uses of Objects

- Store State
- Group Related Functionality
- Create Object Instances
- Objects and the Real World

## Object Creation Techniques

- **Using Contructor Function**
- **Object Literal**
- **Object.create()**
- **Class**

## Object-oriented Concepts

### OOP Benefits

- Code reuse
- Faster development time frames
- Real-world mapping of objects
- Modular architecture
- More maintainable code base

### Principles of Object-oriented Programming

- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

#### Abstraction

Abstract complex functionality into an object that can be used as the base for other objects

#### Encapsulation

In object-oriented programming, encapsulation refers to the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, or the restricting of direct access of some of an object's components. Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing unauthorized parties direct access to them

#### Inheritance

In OOO, inheritance is the mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object or class, retaining similar implementation.

#### Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.
